- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt

- 1/8 tsp ground nutmeg

- 1 1/3 cups finely grated carrots

### instructions - carrot cake mixture
1. rinse beaters clean. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and nutmeg for 30 seconds.
2. in a separate large mixing bowl, add canola oil, applesauce, granulated sugar, brown sugar, eggs and vanilla extract and blend mixture using electric hand mixer set on low speed for 1 minute.
3. with mixer running on low speed, slowly add in dry ingredients and mix until well blended. 
4. add carrots and mix until evenly distributed. Tap bowl forcefully against counter, about 3 times, just to release large air pockets.

### instructions - assemble cheesecake
1. pour 1½ cups carrot cake mixture into buttered springform pan and spread into an even layer. 
2. dollop about 1/3 of the cream cheese mixture by the spoonfuls over carrot cake layer (don't spread or swirl).
3. spoon remaining carrot cake mixture over cream cheese layer, then finish by drizzling by the remaining cheesecake mixture over carrot cake layer, working to cover all of the carrot cake mixture (I found this easiest to do this was by slowly drizzling over with the spoon).
4. bake in preheated oven 60 - 65 minutes, until center portion only jiggles slightly and tenting with aluminum foil at 40 minutes to prevent excessive browning (tent in a way that the foil doesn't touch cheesecake or it will stick). 
5. remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack 1 hour, then cover with foil and chill in refrigerator 6 hours or overnight.
