# sugar cookies

### Ingredients
- 1 Cup Unsalted Butter, softened to room temperature
- 1 Cup Sugar
- 1 1/2 tsp. Vanilla Extract
- 1 large egg
- 2 1/2 Cups Flour
- 3/4 tsp. baking powder
- 1/2 tsp. Salt

### Preparation
- Preheat oven to 350°F.

### Instructions
1. Combine butter and sugar in the bowl with an electric hand mixer and beat until creamy.

2. Add egg and vanilla extract and beat until completely combined.

3. In a separate, medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until completely combined.

4. Use plastic wrap to mold dough into discs and chill for at least 2-3 hours.

5. Once dough has finished chilling, preheat the oven to 350°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.

6. Generously dust a clean surface with flour and deposit one chilled cookie dough disk onto the surface. Lightly flour the dough and roll out to 1/8" (for thinner, crispier cookies) or 1/4" (for thicker, softer cookies). Use cookie cutters to cut out shapes and use a spatula to transfer shapes to prepared baking sheet.

7. Bake for 9-10 minutes, or until edges just begin to turn lightly golden brown.
