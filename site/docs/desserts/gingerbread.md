# Gingerbread Cookies

### Ingredients:
- 3 cups All-Purpose Flour
- ¼ tsp. Salt
- 2 tsp. Ginger
- 1 tsp. Cinnamon
- ¼ tsp. Nutmeg
- 1 tsp. Baking Soda
- ¾ cup Brown Sugar, firmly packed
- ¾ cup Butter, softened
- ½ cup Molasses
- 1 Large Egg
- 1 tsp. Vanilla Extract

### Preparation:
- Preheat oven to 350°F.

### Instructions:
1. Ysing a hand-held mixer, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. Add the brown sugar and molasses and beat on medium high speed until combined and creamy. Next, beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 minutes. The butter may separate; that’s ok.

2. In a separate bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves together until combined. On low speed, slowly mix into the wet ingredients. 

3. Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. Chill discs for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. 

4. Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously flour a work surface and roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Place 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. 

5. Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes. If your cookie cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes.

Note: Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.
