>"You've got to climb to the top of Mount Everest
> to reach the Valley of the Dolls [...]
> You stand there, 
> waiting for the rush of exhilaration
> you'd thought you'd feel - 
> but it doesn't come.
> You're too far away to hear the applause
> and take your bows.
> And there's no place left to climb..."
